# Release Project for Data Prepper

The projects in this directory include different mechanisms for releasing Data Prepper. Each subdirectory in here provides a different
mechanism for the release process. See the `README.md` in each sub-directory for specifics on what it does.

The [`release-notes`](release-notes) sub-directory is different from the other sub-directories.
It is not a project and instead holds release notes and change logs for Data Prepper releases.

## Performing a Release

See [RELEASING.md](../RELEASING.md) for instructions to follow for any release.
